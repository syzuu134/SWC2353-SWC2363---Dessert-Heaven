                <h2>Sweet things to satisfied your craving</h2>
                <p>At Dessert Heaven, we believe in the emotional power of food. For many of us, food is a language of love. It's more than just nourishment. It's memories, it's connection, it's comfort.
                    <br><br>We understand how truly important our mission is. We are here to bring a smile to people’s faces, an edible hug, a connection to a loved one even though you may not be with them, a moment of nostalgic comfort, a craving from a beloved food memory.
                    <br><br>We believe that food brings people together, so we've created a place that connects people with their greatest food memories, experiences and desires. We’ve built a platform that empowers small shops, chefs & restaurants and inspires their passion.</p>

                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>With Decades Of Combined Experience In The World Of Pastry And Confectionery, Our Team Of Dedicated Bakers And Artisans Bring A Wealth Of Knowledge And Creativity To Every Dessert We Create. From Classic Recipes Passed Down Through Generations To Cutting-Edge Innovations, We Merge Tradition With Innovation To Offer A Diverse And Delectable Menu.</p>
                
                <br><p>The year was 2020 when Corina (Founder of Dessert Heaven) first began baking in the humble settings of her home. A passion that eventually turned into a home business. From a menu created in 2019 for family & friends to purchase, to the eventual birth of Whipped cakes in 2020.

                    <br><br>During those early days, we baked from our home and focused on supplying to discerning cafes and restaurants.  By 29 August 2021, we took the challenge to set up a central kitchen in Taman Shamelin Perkasa and moved away from home.With an initial offering of only 9 flavours, we grew to offering over 30 different varieties of cakes & bakes and began to sell them online in March 2023.
                    
                    <br><br>And now we continue to expand our range to include breads & pastries, solidifying our presence as a bakery of unique & original treats.
